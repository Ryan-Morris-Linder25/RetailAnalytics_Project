# Regork Retail Analytics

## Overview
This project explores customer sales data for a fictional Kroger-like retailer ("Regork") in 2017, with a focus on identifying opportunities to expand vegetarian and vegan product categories. The analysis considers purchasing trends, customer segmentation, and regional performance.

## Key Questions
- Should Regork expand the Vegetarian/Vegan Categories?
- Which customer groups are buying plant-based products?
- Where should Regork test expansion?

## Key Insights
-**High growth potential**: Top vegetarian/vegan categories like Vegetarian Meats and Soy Beverages outpaced overall market growth, signaling strong consumer demand and minimal risk for expansion.
-**Target demographics identified**: Primary consumers fall between ages 25–54, earn $34k–$74k, and typically come from one- or two-adult households — making them ideal targets for future marketing.
-**Test market & cross-sell strategy**: Stores 367, 381, and 321 are optimal for low-risk rollouts; commonly paired items (bananas, yogurt, milk) offer strong cross-merchandising opportunities.
